# Hands off from the launcher to the engine. Shared by every port.
#
# The launcher has already settled configuration (Settings.json, the game's
# ini files, FirstRun) and created the crash sentinel, and it chdir's to
# GameDir before exec'ing this script. Everything here is about starting
# Surreal Engine and honouring the sentinel contract on the way out.
#
# A port adjusts this through port-hooks.sh beside it (see docs/PORTING.md):
#   PORT_LIB_PATH       extra library directories, searched after the app dir
#   port_env            runs once the environment below is set up
#   port_before_game    runs just before the engine starts (e.g. CPU mode)
#   port_after_game     runs after it exits, with its status in $status
