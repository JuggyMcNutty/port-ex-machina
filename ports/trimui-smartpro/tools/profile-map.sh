# Frame-time profile of one map, on the handheld.
#
# Needs an engine built with engine-patches/optional/perf-instrumentation.patch
# applied (the hooks are temporary and never committed -- see the patch header
# comments). From the repository root:
#
#   scripts/engine.sh perf on
#   scripts/dx.sh deploy trimui-smartpro      (builds and stages it too)
#   scripts/dx.sh profile trimui-smartpro [seconds] [label] [cpu] [turn] [map]
#   scripts/engine.sh perf off
#   scripts/dx.sh deploy trimui-smartpro
#
# dx.sh profile copies this script to the device's /tmp/dxl-test (a reboot
# clears it) and runs it there:
#
#   profile-map.sh [seconds] [label] [cpu] [turn] [map]
#
#   seconds  how long to run (default 60)
#   label    names the log: /tmp/dxl-test/perf-<label>.log
#   cpu      "launcher" (default): the CPU mode launcher.ini's CpuMode names,
#            applied and restored by the app's port-hooks.sh exactly as a
#            launch does, so a profile measures what playing gets. "none"
#            leaves the CPU as the menu has it (power-save).
#   turn     aBaseX to turn the player on the spot (3000 = keyboard turn speed),
#            so an unattended run still brings new surfaces into view
#   map      default 01_NYC_UNATCOIsland.dx (Liberty Island). The engine only
#            takes --url=<map>; "-u <map>" silently loads the default map.
#
# SURREAL_PERF_DETAIL=1 in the environment adds tick by actor class and script
# functions by self time; those hooks slow what they measure. SAMPLE=1 samples
# the main thread's CPU every millisecond into /tmp/dxl-test/samples-<label>
# (and .maps), for scripts/sample-report.py on the PC. SHOT=<seconds>
# (a multiple of 5) saves the screen at that point to
# /tmp/dxl-test/fb-<label>.gz -- the raw framebuffer, gzipped; its first
# 1280x720 is BGRA (magick -size 1280x720 -depth 8 bgra:fb -alpha off out.png).
#
# The spruceOS menu is paused while the engine runs (two programs drawing to
# one framebuffer fight) and resumed on exit. The engine ignores SIGTERM, so
# it is stopped with SIGKILL; that leaves Running.ini like any crash.
