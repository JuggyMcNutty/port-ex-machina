# IpDrv.dll

The native half of package IpDrv: the sockets. The UDP driver under the
network protocol ([the network](network.md)); the script's TCP and UDP links,
through which the menus and servers reach the master server and each other;
GameSpy's answer to a master server's challenge; and two tools of Epic's as
commandlets, a master server and an update server. How it was read:
[working on the binaries](README.md#working-on-the-binaries).

It registers seven classes: `InternetLink`, `TcpLink` and `UdpLink`, whose
script layouts match; `TcpNetDriver` and `TcpipConnection`, C++ only (the
SDK's `IpDrvPrivate.h` has them); and `MasterServerCommandlet` and
`UpdateServerCommandlet`, which it does not export. The natives are the
links': eight of `InternetLink`, nine of `TcpLink`, five of `UdpLink`.

## The net driver

- **The socket** (`UTcpNetDriver::InitBase`, `0x1070abb0`): one UDP socket,
  non-blocking, with broadcast and address reuse on, and send and receive
  buffers of 32 KB for a client, 128 KB for a server. A client binds any
  port. A server binds its URL's port (7790 in `DeusEx.ini`), or the next
  free one of the 20 from it -- only that one when the command line gives
  `PORT=`.
- **Receiving** (`TickDispatch`, `0x1070a440`): each tick, every datagram
  waiting, up to 576 bytes each, goes to the connection whose address sent
  it; one from an unknown address, on a server that accepts it
  (`NotifyAcceptingConnection`), opens a new connection.
- **A connection** (`UTcpipConnection`): its packets are at most 512 bytes
  (`MaxPacket`); `LowLevelSend` (`0x10709580`) sends each as one datagram.

## The script's links

What the menus, the server browser and a server's uplink are made of: an
actor per socket, polled each tick. An `IpAddr` is in host byte order -- the
address's first number in its top byte -- and its port a plain number. A new
link is set up by its C++ constructor, over the class's defaults: text link
mode, receive by events, no socket (`0x10702480`).

- **`InternetLink`:** `Resolve` looks a host name up on a thread of its own
  and raises `Resolved` or `ResolveFailed` from the actor's tick
  (`0x10702d70`, `0x107026a0`), the port 0. `IpAddrToString` writes
  `a.b.c.d:port`; `StringToIpAddr` takes the address alone (with a port it
  fails), the port 0. `ParseURL`, `GetLocalIP` (the first address of the
  machine's own name), `GetLastError`, `IsDataPending`, and `Validate`
  ([below](#the-master-server)).
- **`TcpLink`:** `BindPort` (any port when given none; with
  `bUseNextAvailable`, the first free of the 20 from the one given),
  `Listen`, `Open`, `Close`, `IsConnected`, `SendText` (a line end added in
  line mode, everything queued in the send FIFO and the whole length
  answered), `SendBinary`, `ReadText`, `ReadBinary`. Its tick (`0x10706fb0`)
  goes by its state:
  - listening, it accepts a queued connection (`CheckConnectionQueue`) into
    a new actor of its `AcceptClass`, connected and in the listener's link
    mode, or with none into itself (its `RemoteSocket`), and raises
    `Accepted` on the one that took it;
  - connecting, it waits for the socket to turn writable
    (`CheckConnectionAttempt`) and raises `Opened` -- on Windows a failed
    connection never does, and the script's own timer gives up;
  - connected, and while a close is pending, it reads (`PollConnections`):
    by events, one read a tick of up to 999 bytes, raised whole as
    `ReceivedText`, `ReceivedLine` or `ReceivedBinary` by the link mode;
    by hand, it only marks `DataPending`. Then it sends what the FIFO holds
    (`FlushSendBuffer`), and a pending close, once all is sent, shuts the
    sending side (`ShutdownConnection`);
  - whatever the state, a connection that reads as ended -- a peek of one
    byte finding nothing, or an error but would-block -- is closed, the
    link back to initialized unless it is still listening, and `Closed`
    raised.
- **`UdpLink`:** `BindPort` makes the socket (broadcast on, non-blocking)
  and binds as `TcpLink`'s does; `SendText` sends the text as it is, no line
  end in any mode, and answers false only when nothing went; `SendBinary`,
  `ReadText`, `ReadBinary`. Its tick (`0x1070cee0`), by events, reads one
  datagram a tick, up to 4,095 bytes, and raises it whole as `ReceivedText`,
  `ReceivedLine` or `ReceivedBinary` with the sender's address; by hand, it
  only marks `DataPending`.

## The master server

- **The client's side** is script, `DeusEx.u`'s `DeusExGSpyLink`: over TCP to
  `MasterServerAddress`, it waits for `\basic\\secure\` and six characters,
  answers `\gamename\` (the game's name), `\location\`, `\validate\` (the
  challenge put through `Validate`) and `\final\`, and reads back `\ip\`
  entries, an address and port each, until `\final\`. `DeusExServerPing`
  then asks each server for its details over UDP.
- **`Validate(challenge, gameName)`** (`0x107034c0`): GameSpy's answer -- the
  challenge encrypted with the game's key (RC4) and written in eight
  characters of base 64. The key comes from a table of three games
  (`GenerateSecretKey`, `0x107017f0`: Unreal, Unreal Tournament and an old
  version); for any other name it is six spaces, so Deus Ex's answer needs no
  secret.
- **A server's side** is script too, `IpServer.u`'s `UdpServerUplink`
  (heartbeats to the addresses in `DeusEx.ini`) and `UdpServerQuery`
  (answering queries).
- **Epic's master server** is here as a commandlet
  (`UMasterServerCommandlet`, settings in `MasterServer.ini`): it takes
  servers' heartbeats over UDP, checks each with its own challenge, and lists
  them over TCP, or writes them to a file. The GOG build has no `ucc` to run
  it.

## The database

`gamefiles/System/IpDrv.dll.i64` has the class layouts, the UTF-16 strings and
the initializers' names ([working on the binaries](README.md#working-on-the-binaries)),
and by hand the names of the key table and the encryption's helpers
(`GenerateSecretKey`, `rc4_prepare_key`, `rc4`, `trip2kwart`, `encode_ct`).
Each function above carries a one-line comment.
