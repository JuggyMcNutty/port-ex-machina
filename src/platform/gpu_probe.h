/* GPU detection, isolated from the launcher process.
 *
 * Loads the Vulkan loader and EGL with dlopen, in a forked child, and reports
 * what they offer. A driver that crashes or hangs during initialisation takes
 * the child down, not the launcher -- the same reason the original ran
 * -testrendev in a child process (docs/re/wizard.md, Renderer page).
 *
 * Neither library is linked: a device with no Vulkan loader must still start
 * the launcher and simply show Vulkan as unavailable.
 *
 * Call it before SDL brings up the display. On the handheld the probe and the
 * vendor SDL driver talk to the same PowerVR stack, and the child should be
 * done with it before the launcher's own window exists.
