/* The device profile: what the launcher needs to know about where it runs.
 *
 * A port can supply its own as ports/<id>/target.c; a port without one gets
 * platform/target_default.c, a generic desktop. The build compiles exactly
 * one (DXL_PROFILE, which defaults to the port), so -DDXL_PROFILE=<id> on a
 * host build shows another device's screens -- how dxl-shots renders the
 * handheld's UI on a PC. docs/PORTING.md says what a new device needs.
 *
 * Only facts about the device belong here. Facts about a GPU (the PowerVR's
 * MSAA resolve) follow the GPU wherever it turns up: core/renderers.h.
