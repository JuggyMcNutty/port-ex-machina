/* Which renderers exist, and which of them can actually run here.
 *
 * Two independent facts decide that, and the screen shows both:
 *
 *   - Does this *engine build* have a backend for it? Declared per renderer
 *     in renderers.ini as EngineType -- the value Settings.json
 *     RenderDevice.Type takes. Empty means the engine has no such backend
 *     (Surreal Engine has no software renderer at all, and no GLES one until
 *     the fork adds it).
 *   - Does *this device* have the graphics API it needs? Measured at startup
 *     by the GPU probe (platform/gpu_probe.c), never assumed.
 *
 * The original enumerated Win32 3D devices by re-executing itself with
 * -testrendev= per candidate so a crashing driver only killed a child
 * (docs/re/wizard.md, Renderer page). The probe keeps that idea -- detection
 * runs in a forked child -- without the re-exec.
 *
 * The choice is written to Settings.json, not to [Engine.Engine]
 * GameRenderDevice: Surreal Engine overrides that ini key with its own device
 * class, so writing it changed nothing.
