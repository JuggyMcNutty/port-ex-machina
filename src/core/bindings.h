/* Controller layouts: the Joy* lines of User.ini [Engine.Input].
 *
 * The engine already resolves Joy1..Joy16, JoyX/Y/Z/R/U/V and JoyPov* through
 * the same binding table as the keyboard (Engine::InputEvent -> InputCommand),
 * so a layout is nothing more than those 26 lines. The fork's gamepad support
 * (engine-patches/0003) is what makes the pad produce them.
 *
 * Presets are data. Applying one rewrites every Joy key -- including the ones
 * it leaves empty, so nothing from a previous layout lingers -- and touches
 * no other line of User.ini.
 *
 * Axis speeds assume the fork's convention: a stick at full deflection sends
 * 100, the engine multiplies axis input by 16, and InputCommand multiplies by
 * Speed. Keyboard run speed is MoveForward's 300 x 20 = 6000, so
 * Speed=3.75 gives the same top speed on the stick.
