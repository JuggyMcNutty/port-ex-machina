/* Game-data validation.
 *
 * The original's equivalent is the CD check: loop on
 * <CdPath>Textures\Palettes.utx, showing a modal box until the disc appears
 * (docs/re/launch-flow.md section 8). On a handheld the real first-run failure
 * is not a missing disc, it is that the user has not copied their game files
 * across yet -- so this generalises to "is there an install here, and if not,
 * which pieces are missing".
 *
 * Lookups are case-insensitive: the SD card is exFAT, but an install copied
 * via a Linux host may have any case, and the 2000-era names are mixed.
