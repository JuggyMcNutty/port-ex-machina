/* Running.ini -- the entire crash-detection mechanism.
 *
 * Created after the wizard, deleted on clean exit. If it survives, the next
 * launch shows the recovery screen. There is nothing else to it: no signal
 * handler, no log parsing, no heuristics. docs/re/launch-flow.md sections 5
 * and 9.
 *
 * The one subtlety, from the original: it is created AFTER the wizard, not
 * before. A wizard sitting open for three minutes must not look like a crash
 * if the user gives up and kills it -- confirmed live, the file stayed absent
 * through 2m47s of open wizard.
