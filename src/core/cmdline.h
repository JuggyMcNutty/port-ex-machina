/* Command-line parsing, reproducing UE1's three helpers exactly.
 *
 * docs/re/cli-flags.md is emphatic that these are NOT equivalent, and that the
 * difference is observable:
 *
 *   dxl_cmd_param   ParseParam(s,"X")  -- "-X" or "/X", must end at whitespace
 *   dxl_cmd_value   Parse(s,"X=",v)    -- case-insensitive substring "X=",
 *                                         value runs to whitespace, quotable
 *   dxl_cmd_find    appStrfind(s,"X")  -- raw case-insensitive substring,
 *                                         no leading '-' required at all
 *
 * The last one is the surprising one. "readini" and the four single-instance
 * bypass tokens match anywhere in the command line, including inside a map
 * name or a URL. A port that reached for a normal argv parser here would
 * behave differently from the original in ways players would eventually hit,
 * so the launcher keeps the command line as one string and matches on it.
