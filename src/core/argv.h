/* The argument vector the game is started with.

 * The launcher keeps its command line as one string, as the original did
 * (docs/re/cli-flags.md: appStrfind matches anywhere), and splits it exactly
 * once, here, when handing over to the game. The hand-over itself is the
 * platform's: platform/launch.h.
 *
 * The original also re-executed itself for safe mode with a flag string built
 * from eight checkboxes. Surreal Engine honours none of those flags, so that
 * path is gone; docs/DESIGN.md records why.
