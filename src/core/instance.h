/* Single-instance detection and command-line handoff.
 *
 * The original does two separate things that are easy to conflate:
 *
 *   1. CreateMutex("DeusExIsRunning") + ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS, used ONLY to
 *      decide whether a surviving Running.ini means a crash or a concurrent
 *      instance (docs/re/porting-notes.md section 3).
 *   2. FindWindowEx for a WLog window carrying the "IsBrowser" property, then
 *      WM_COPYDATA with the tail of the command line and a 30s timeout
 *      (section 2) -- so a second launch opens a URL in the running game
 *      instead of starting a second copy.
 *
 * Both survive here; only the transport changes. The lock is flock on a
 * pidfile, and the channel is a Linux abstract unix socket, so nothing is left
 * behind on the filesystem if the process dies -- which matters on exFAT,
 * where a stale lock file would be indistinguishable from a live one.
 *
 * The protocol is unchanged: one message, the command line.
