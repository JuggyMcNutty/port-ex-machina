/* Path handling across the Windows/POSIX seam.
 *
 * The engine's config is full of Windows paths -- "..\Save\", "CdPath=..\",
 * "Textures\Palettes.utx". docs/re/porting-notes.md section 7 is the rule we
 * follow: normalise for *lookup*, but keep writing whatever the engine
 * expects. So dxl_path_from_ini() converts on the way in, and stored values
 * are never rewritten just because we read them.
 *
 * Case: the device's SD card is exFAT, which is case-insensitive, but a host
 * build on ext4 is not, and the ini files name files in whatever case the
 * 2000-era tools used. dxl_path_resolve_ci() bridges that.
