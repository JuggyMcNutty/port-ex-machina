/* The launcher's screens, and the navigation between them.
 *
 * A controller-first home: four tabs switched with L1/R1 -- Play, Video,
 * Controls, System -- and START launches from any of them. The original's
 * six-page wizard asked one question per page because it had to fit a
 * mouse-driven Win32 dialog; on a handheld the same decisions are simply
 * settings, each with a line of help saying what it really changes.
 *
 * What the original's entry decision (docs/re/wizard.md) chose between is
 * still honoured, as where the home screen opens:
 *
 *   first run / -changevideo   Video tab
 *   -safe                      System tab
 *   crash sentinel survived    Play tab, with the crash explained and the
 *                              cursor on Troubleshoot
 *
 * The install screen stands alone: until the game files are there, there is
 * nothing else to do.
