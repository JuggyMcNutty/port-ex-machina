/* Palette, metrics and font selection.
 *
 * The look follows the game's own UI: near-black ground with amber/gold text.
 * That is not decoration -- the launcher is the first thing someone sees, and
 * having it match means the handheld build does not feel bolted on.
 *
 * Every metric is expressed for the 1280x720 panel this targets first but
 * derived from the actual surface size, so a different device is a
 * configuration change rather than a rewrite.
