# Surreal Engine patches

[Surreal Engine](https://github.com/dpjudas/SurrealEngine) is an open-source
reimplementation of Unreal Engine 1. It recognises this exact Deus Ex build —
`DeusEx.exe` SHA1 `2a933e26aa9cfb33b37f78afe21434caa031f14a` is its
`DEUS_EX_1112fm` database entry — and it is the runtime this launcher is aimed
at.

## Fork only. Never upstream.

The project ships a `NO-AI Code Rule.md`:

> If you are primarily using LLM tools such as Claude to make code changes to
> this codebase then please do not PR it to us. Keep it in a fork. Thank you.

These patches were written with Claude. They stay in a fork and are **not** to
be submitted upstream, in any form. Using and building the engine is separately
permitted by its own license, which grants use "for any purpose".

If a change here turns out to be worth upstreaming, it needs rewriting by a
person from the problem statement, not adapting from this diff.

## Base

Applied on top of the upstream commit in `UPSTREAM-BASE.txt`.

## 0001 — headless and embedded support

Three changes, all in `SurrealEngine/GameApp.cpp`. None touch engine behaviour;
they exist because the upstream front end assumes a desktop with a mouse.

1. **Skip the launcher window** when a game folder is given on the command line,
   or on `--no-launcher`. Upstream always calls `LauncherWindow::ExecModal()`,
   so the engine cannot be started without clicking a desktop GUI. Needed to
   drive it from a test rig, and needed on the handheld — there is no mouse, and
   game selection already happened in our own launcher before this process
   started.

2. **Report exceptions to stderr** as well as the modal error window. The error
   text was otherwise only visible inside a GUI; with no one to close it, the
   modal spins at 100% CPU in its event loop. This is how the real first failure
   ("Failed to initialize OpenAL device") was found at all.

3. **Stream the engine log to stderr** in headless/verbose mode. `LogUnimplemented()`
   is how the engine reports which natives a game still needs, and that list is
   the actual work item for Deus Ex support — it is worth nothing trapped in a
   window.

## Running it headlessly

```sh
ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null \
SurrealEngine --no-launcher /path/to/deusex
```

`ALSOFT_DRIVERS=null` is only needed where there is no audio device (a container);
the handheld has ALSA.
